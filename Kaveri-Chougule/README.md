## Challenges Faced

During the development of this extension, I encountered several challenges, especially when working with the Chrome Extension API. Here are some of the difficulties I faced and how I overcame them:

1. **Dynamic Updates and Real-time Calculations:**
   - Implementing dynamic updates for the invoice in real-time presented a challenge. Ensuring that changes to item details, such as quantity and price, immediately reflected in the subtotal, taxes, and total amount required meticulous handling of JavaScript events and data synchronization.

2. **Responsive Design for Various Devices:**
   - Creating a responsive design that functions seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes was a significant challenge. It required careful consideration of CSS media queries and testing on a variety of devices to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience.

3. **Print-Friendly Styles:**
   - Designing a print-friendly version of the invoice while maintaining a visually appealing on-screen layout presented a balancing act. Ensuring that the printed invoice retained clarity and professionalism without sacrificing the on-screen aesthetics required fine-tuning of CSS styles specific to print media.

Despite the challenges encountered, each obstacle presented an opportunity for growth and improvement. Overcoming these hurdles not only enhanced the functionality of the Invoice Generator but also provided valuable insights into the intricacies of web development and user experience design.
