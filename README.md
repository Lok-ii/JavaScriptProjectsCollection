### Chrome-Extension: 

## Overview

. This Chrome extension allows users to add timestamps to any YouTube video through a button which is added to the YouTube player. Clicking this button adds the current timestamp to the extension.
. The added timestamps are displayed within the extension, accompanied by play and delete buttons. Clicking the play button initiates playback from the corresponding timestamp, while the delete button removes the timestamp.

## Features

- Add timestamps to YouTube videos.
- Play videos from the specified timestamps.
- Delete timestamps from the extension, removing them from storage.
- Use the YouTube player button to quickly add timestamps.
- Stored data is maintained using `chrome.storage.local`.
  
## Usage

1. Open a YouTube video.
2. Use the extension to add timestamps.
3. Click on the extension icon to view, play, or delete timestamps.
4. If timestamps exist for a video, they are displayed when the video is played.
5. Utilize the plus icon in the YouTube player to quickly add timestamps.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of this extension, I encountered several challenges, especially when working with the Chrome Extension API. Here are some of the difficulties I faced and how I overcame them:

1. **Understanding Chrome Extension Architecture:**
   - Initially, grasping the architecture of Chrome extensions was a challenge. I spent time studying the documentation and examples to gain a better understanding.

2. **Interacting with the YouTube Player:**
   - Integrating the extension with the YouTube player required understanding the YouTube webpage architecture and how to communicate with it from the extension. I found the official documentation and online forums to be valuable resources.

3. **Handling Asynchronous Operations:**
   - Managing asynchronous operations, such as storage interactions and content script execution, posed challenges. I learned about JavaScript's asynchronous nature and utilized promises to handle these situations more effectively.

4. **Debugging and Testing:**
   - Debugging Chrome extensions can be different from traditional web development. I used the Chrome Developer Tools and console.log statements to troubleshoot issues. Additionally, setting up a test environment helped catch potential problems early on.

By documenting these challenges and solutions, I hope to provide insights for others who may be embarking on a similar learning journey. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the extension.

In this webpage we create a typing test generator, which provides us with a paragraph and tests our typing speed in # wpm i.e number of words typed per minute and  # cpm i.e number of characters typed per minute. Along with this it also calculates the number of mistakes done and the clock ticks back calculating the remaining time. Additional feature of accuracy has been added and one can reset over again after completion of one test or to retry. If one completes all the typing within time limit the timer stops also if time finishes typing disables. <br>

Minesweeper is a puzzle game which the player will select a cell in a square grid continuously. Each cell hides a bomb or a value which displays the number of bombs in itâ€™s neighboring cells. Just to make it clear, neighboring cells is defined as adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
If the player selects a cell which contains the bomb, he/she loses the game. We also have a defined number of red flags which can be planted if we suspect the availability of a mine/bomb, but if the number of flags run out you again lose the Game. So, Play Cunningly. <br>
